# Digital Nurture 5.0 — DotNet FSE Deep Skilling (React Track)

## What is this program?

This is Cognizant's Deep Skilling program that builds on the Upskilling foundation. Over 7 weeks, you'll go from core engineering concepts all the way to deploying containerized microservices and working with GenAI tools.

Before diving in — make sure you've completed the Upskilling handbook first. OOP fundamentals are the backbone of everything covered here.

## How Learning Works

**Two components run in parallel:**

1. **Self-paced learning** — open-source reference links provided for each module
2. **Bi-weekly SME sessions** — live expert sessions (100% attendance mandatory)

To complete the program, you must finish all hands-on exercises AND pass the final Knowledge-Based Assessment (KBA).
